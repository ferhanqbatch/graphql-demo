This is the demo project create by me in which I have setup graphQL basic structure via `gem 'graphql', '1.7.4'`.

Things you may want to cover:

Just clone it. run
`bundle install`
`rake db:create`
`rake db:migrate`
`rake db:seed`
and you are good to go. For documentation please refer to [Contribution guidelines for this project](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-ruby/0-introduction/)
